# PersonalPokemonCardCreator-Public-
A Personal Pok√©mon Card Creator, this is made using Python using the OpenCV and Tkinter libraries.

This is a project made by Patrick Madonna.
Pokemon is Owned by GAME FREAK and The Pokemon Company, I not claim to own anything associated with them.
This falls under parody law, and should be taken as such. This is not representative of the acctual Pokemon Card Game.
In other words don't sue, But please credit.
